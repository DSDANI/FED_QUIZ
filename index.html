        <p1>During the 2011 New York City Fashion Week, top-tier fashion designers, Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough (owners and designers of Proenza Schouler), took the time out of their 'hectic schedules' during fashion week to help promote the work of fashion bloggers. The two were interviewed by Imran Amed, founder, and editor of The Business of Fashion website. In the 5:15 minute long interview, the two fashion designers were asked various questions from an audience of fashion bloggers, including their personal opinions on the effects of fashion blog writing, how it influences the fashion industry as a whole, and how fashion blog posts affect their designing and selling process. When asked about their thoughts on the overall effect of the fashion blogs, McCollough stated, "Blogs posting things about us, going viral, spreading throughout the internet... it has an extraordinary impact on the business". They also stated how in the past, they would have to wait for three, four days to hear a review on their line, but now the feedback comes almost instantly. When asked about how the blogs directly affect their own designs, they explained that while they do read numerous blogs daily, they try to take each criticism (positive or negative) with a grain of salt, "We try not to obsess over it" stated McCollough.</p1>
<p>Founder of Independent Fashion Blogger (IFB), Jennine Jacob, stated how thrilled she was to get the validation from high-end fashion designers (such as Proenza Schouler) that fashion blogging has an incredible impact on the fashion world. Imran Amed stated that there will always be designers and editors that will never fully wrap their head on the huge impact fashion blogging and social media has on the industry, but on the other side of the spectrum, there are numerous designers, editors, branders and writers that do understand and are "coming on board". He also states that this is a fairly new phenomenon that will take time for the fashion world to reap the full benefits.</p>
<p>The New York Times "Style" section writer, Eric Wilson, did an extensive study on the impact of fashion bloggers on the fashion industry for one of his style columns. Wilson wrote that these bloggers have ascended 'from the nosebleed seats to the front row' in the past year and that the divide between the 'high code' editors with a professional opinion and the 'amateur' fashion bloggers is beginning to disintegrate. Wilson interviewed prominent publicists, editors, and designers. Publicist Kelly Cutrone stated that over the past two years, there has been a complete change in who is writing about fashion. Not only does Cutrone say she needs to keep a watch on the editors of mainstream writings, such as Vogue and Elle, but now she needs to monitor on the millions of fashion bloggers around the world. Cutrone goes on the later state that once these bloggers post anything on the internet, it never comes off, and it now becomes the first thing that the designers will see.</p>
<p>The fashion industry is always looking for the latest trends to soak up, reinterpret, and then relaunch in its own way to the rest of the world. This behaviour is also common in web design. So, when the worlds of fashion and Internet collide, we can expect to see websites that blend together the latest visual and technological trends.</p>
<p>Each fashion brand aims to create a unique and characteristic visual style that fits its personality. However, there are certain characteristics that are common to most fashion companies' websites. Most fashion websites rely on the power of visuals to draw attention and let the products speak for themselves. The use of photographs is imperative, hero images and videos are very popular. In most cases, the homepage consists of a large background photo and a navigation menu. The rest of the content is pushed to the background so it does not compete with the displayed products. Black and white is a common colour scheme for most fashion websites, especially those that want to convey an image of elegance and sophistication, while young and playful brands use a lot of colour.</p>
<p>The main objective of a fashion website is to keep the viewer in the site long enough for them to see the latest collection. Some fashion websites have interactive elements and try to transform the visit into a sensory experience for the user.</p>
